# Challify
## v1.0 by William Timkey - CSE199 - University at Buffalo

**Professor Challen's 199 class is all about the Internet, so it's time we made the Internet all about him.**

This extension replaces any common name from [this database](https://github.com/enorvelle/NameDatabases/blob/master/NamesDatabases/first%20names/us.txt). It's unnecessarily long, but it was hard to find one with a good length.

It can be installed as either a userscript, or a developer chrome extension.

#To install as a userscript:

1. Intall the Tampermonkey extension in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) 

2. Click [Here](https://github.com/wtimkey/Challify/master/Userscript/Challify.js) to install the userscript. It will run by default on any website.
