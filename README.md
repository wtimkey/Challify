# Challify
## v1.0 by William Timkey - CSE199 - University at Buffalo

**Professor Challen's 199 class is all about the Internet, so it's time we made the Internet all about him.**

This extension replaces any common name from [this database](https://github.com/enorvelle/NameDatabases/blob/master/NamesDatabases/first%20names/us.txt). It's unnecessarily long, but it was hard to find one with a good length. The function used to replace the text comes from T.J. Crowder on Stack Overflow and can be found [here.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5904914/javascript-regex-to-replace-text-not-in-html-attributes/5904945)

It can be installed as either a userscript, or a Chrome extension (.crx). The raw code for the extension is availbable as well.

*Note: The extension and userscript will cripple your page load speeds on text-heavy websites. This is obviosly not a practical tool. I could probably write the code for this much better, but it's just a joke done in good humor. I hope that nobody is offended by it for whatever reason, and that it can bring a smile to your faces! Thanks for a great semester Prof. Challen!*
